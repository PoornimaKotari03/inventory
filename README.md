I build this backend for maintaining an inventory


In this system we can:
List of all stores for the user,
List out all the books in inventory inside the store.,
Add a new book.,
Update inventory for an existing book.,
Remove from the inventory.

Install dependencies for server
npm install

Connect to your mongodb and add info in .env

Run the server 
npm run dev

Run the Express server only
npm run server

Server runs on http://localhost:5000
